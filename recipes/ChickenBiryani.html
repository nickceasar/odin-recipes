        <h2>How to prepare Chicken Biryani</h2>


        <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</p></li>

<li><p>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</p></li>

<li><p>2 large onions, finely chopped</p></li>

<li><p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p></li>

<li><p>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</p></li>

<li><p>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p></li>

<li><p>1 teaspoon salt</p></li>

<li><p>1 teaspoon ground cumin</p></li>

<li><p>½ teaspoon chili powder</p></li>

<li><p>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</p></li>

<li><p>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</p></li>

<li><p>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</p></li>

<li><p>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</p></li>

<li><p>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</p></li>

<li><p>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</p></li>

<li><p>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</p></li>

<li><p>1 pound basmati rice</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Gather all ingredients.</p></li>

<li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p></li>

<li><p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</p></li>

<li><p>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</p></li>

<li><p>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</p></li>

<li><p>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</p></li>

<li><p>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</p></li>

<li><p>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</p></li>

<li><p>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p></li>
